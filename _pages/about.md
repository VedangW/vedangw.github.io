I am a Machine Learning Engineer II at TikTok, working on the creator monetization integrity team. 
I have 2.5 years of industry experience working in Data Science and engineering teams at two of the 
[top startups](https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies)
([Faire](https://www.faire.com/) and [Razorpay](https://razorpay.com/)), and research experience 
applying and improving Machine Learning models in the domains of Natural Language Processing, 
Drug Discovery, and Computational Genomics.

I finished my master's in Computer Science from Rutgers University with a Machine Learning
concentration in May 2023 and my bachelor's in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology 
and Science (BITS), Pilani (Goa campus) in May 2019.

In my industry roles, I have worked in Data Science and engineering teams in social media, fintech, 
and e-commerce companies. I have worked on challenging industry problems like creator spam detection, fraud detection, last-mile delivery, underwriting, and recommender systems. My work has involved development of the full 
end-to-end ML pipeline including data curation, feature engineering, model development, deployment, monitoring, 
backend development, and maintenance.

## Selected Projects

Following are some personal and academic projects I have pursued in the past couple of years related to Machine Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, and Software Engineering.

1. **Visual Question Answering with Vision-Language Models** (2023) \
  [[Code](https://github.com/VedangW/git-vqa)], [[Paper](/assets/pdf/git-vqa.pdf)] \
  Adapts the [GIT model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.14100) by Microsoft for the Visual Question Answering task and evaluates it on the challenging [AOKVQA](https://allenai.org/project/a-okvqa/home) dataset by the Allen Institute for AI. The dataset is designed to test the model's ability to reason using diverse knowledge sources and commonsense.

2. **Unsupervised Passage Retrieval for Fact-Checking and Entity Linking** (2022) \
  [[Code](https://github.com/VedangW/upr-kilt)], [[Paper](/assets/pdf/upr-kilt.pdf)] \
  Builds on the [Unsupervised Passage Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.07496.pdf) method by extending its formulation for Fact-Checking and Entity Linking tasks as well as evaluating it's performance on the Question Answering datasets from the [KILT](https://ai.meta.com/tools/kilt/) benchmark by Meta.

3. **IQ Tests on Pretrained Vision Transformers** (2022) \
  [[Code](https://github.com/VedangW/abstract-visual-reasoning-vit)], [[Paper](/assets/pdf/abstract-visual-reasoning-vit.pdf)] \
  Evaulates and improves the performance of the pretrained Vision Transformer and BEiT models on the Raven's Progressive Matrices IQ test using the [I-Raven](https://github.com/husheng12345/SRAN) dataset.

4. **Gated Graph Neural Networks for Text Classification** (2022) \
  [[Code](https://github.com/VedangW/TextING-PyTorch)], [[Paper](/assets/pdf/texting-pytorch.pdf)] \
  Re-implementation of the [TextING model](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13826.pdf) using PyTorch for ease of use. Converts text to graphs and builds a Gated Graph Neural Network model for text classification and evaluates it on four standard datasets, closely replicating the original results.
